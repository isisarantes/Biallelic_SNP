# Biallelic_SNP


An adaptation of Ruby script available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmatschiner/snapp_prep/master/snapp_prep.rb to create files to run in the SNAPP (Beast2)

This script prepares NEX format input files for the software SNAPP (http://beast2.org/snapp/), given a phylip or vcf format SNP matrix, a table linking species IDs and specimen IDs. 

To learn about the available options of this script, run with '-h' (or without any options): 
```
ruby snapp_prep_ICA.rb -h
```
